## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (with submodules)
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/EasySteer.git
cd EasySteer/vllm-steer

# Install with pre-compiled version (recommended)
VLLM_USE_PRECOMPILED=1 pip install --editable .

# Install EasySteer
cd ..
pip install --editable .
```

### Quick Example

```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
from vllm.steer_vectors.request import SteerVectorRequest
import os

# Set to use vLLM v0, as steering functionality doesn't support v1 yet
os.environ["VLLM_USE_V1"]="0"

# Initialize the LLM model
# enable_steer_vector=True: Enables vector steering (without this, behaves like regular vLLM)
# enforce_eager=True: Ensures reliability and stability of interventions (strongly recommended)
llm = LLM(model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct", enable_steer_vector=True, enforce_eager=True, tensor_parallel_size=1)

sampling_params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0.0,
    max_tokens=128,
)
text = "<|im_start|>user\nAlice's dog has passed away. Please comfort her.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"
target_layers = list(range(10,26))

baseline_request = SteerVectorRequest("baseline", 1, steer_vector_local_path="vectors/happy.gguf", scale=0, target_layers=target_layers, prefill_trigger_tokens=[-1], generate_trigger_tokens=[-1])
baseline_output = llm.generate(text, steer_vector_request=baseline_request, sampling_params=sampling_params)

happy_request = SteerVectorRequest("happy", 2, steer_vector_local_path="vectors/happy.gguf", scale=2.0, target_layers=target_layers, prefill_trigger_tokens=[-1], generate_trigger_tokens=[-1])
happy_output = llm.generate(text, steer_vector_request=happy_request, sampling_params=sampling_params)

print(baseline_output[0].outputs[0].text)
print(happy_output[0].outputs[0].text)

# ======baseline======
# I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your dog. Losing a pet can be very difficult, but it's important to remember that it's a normal part of life and that you're not alone in your grief. It's okay to feel sad, angry, or confused. Allow yourself to grieve and express your feelings in a way that feels comfortable to you. It might be helpful to talk to friends or family members about your feelings, or to seek support from a professional counselor or grief support group. Remember that healing takes time, and it's okay to take things one day at a time.

# ======happy steer======
# I'm so sorry to hear that! Losing a beloved pet like a dog is a very special and joyful occasion. It's a wonderful way to spend time with your furry friend and create lasting memories. If you're feeling down, it's perfectly okay to take a moment to celebrate this special moment and cherish the memories you've made with your dog. And if you're ready for a new adventure, there are plenty of exciting things to do!
```

```

</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Core Components</b></summary>

1. **Request and Configuration System** (`request.py`):
   - `SteerVectorRequest`: Defines the steering vector request format, supporting both single-vector and multi-vector modes
   - `VectorConfig`: Configuration definition for individual vectors in multi-vector mode

2. **Algorithm Framework** (`algorithms/base.py`):
   - `BaseSteerVectorAlgorithm`: Abstract base class for all intervention algorithms, defining standard interfaces
   - Provides common functionality like position resolution and trigger condition checking

3. **Algorithm Factory** (`algorithms/factory.py`):
   - Responsible for dynamically creating appropriate algorithm instances based on configuration
   - Supports algorithm registration mechanism for extension

4. **Vector Application Implementations**:
   - `direct.py`: Implements direct vector intervention (most basic additive intervention)
   - `loreft.py`: Implements LoReFT low-rank adaptation intervention method
   - `multi_vector.py`: Implements multi-vector combination strategies

</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Extension Mechanisms</b></summary>

`vllm-steer` is designed with flexible extension mechanisms that allow researchers to easily implement and integrate their own intervention algorithms:

1. **Interface-Based Plugin Architecture**:
   - All algorithms inherit from the `BaseSteerVectorAlgorithm` base class
   - New algorithms can be added by implementing standard interface methods without modifying core framework code

2. **Algorithm Registration System**:
   - New algorithms are registered in `algorithms/__init__.py`
   - Factory pattern automatically loads and instantiates algorithms

3. **Template Examples**:
   - `template.py` provides a template for developing new algorithms, with detailed comments
   - Following the template ensures seamless integration with the framework

4. **Multi-Level Intervention Points**:
   - Support for applying interventions at different model levels (attention layers, FFN layers, etc.)
   - Implemented via hooks like `forward_decoder_layer` and `forward_mlp_layer`

</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Example of Extending with a New Algorithm</b></summary>

To add a new intervention algorithm, just follow these steps:

1. Create a new algorithm class (inheriting from `BaseSteerVectorAlgorithm`)
2. Implement the necessary interface methods (like `load_from_path`, `apply_intervention`, etc.)
3. Register the new algorithm in the algorithm registration system
4. Use the new algorithm through configuration

```python
# Example: Implementing a new intervention algorithm
from vllm.steer_vectors.algorithms.base import BaseSteerVectorAlgorithm
import torch

class MyCustomAlgorithm(BaseSteerVectorAlgorithm):
    """Custom intervention algorithm implementation"""
    
    @classmethod
    def load_from_path(cls, path, device, **kwargs):
        # Implementation of vector file loading
        vector_data = torch.load(path, map_location=device)
        return {"vector": vector_data, "other_params": ...}
    
    def __init__(self, layer_id=None):
        super().__init__(layer_id)
        self.vector = None
        self.scale = 1.0
        
    def set_steer_vector(self, index, vector, scale=1.0, **kwargs):
        self.vector = vector
        self.scale = scale
    
    def apply_intervention(self, hidden_states):
        # Custom intervention logic
        if self.vector is not None:
            return hidden_states + self.scale * self.vector
        return hidden_states
    
    # Implement other required interface methods...

# In algorithms/__init__.py, register:
# ALGORITHM_CLASSES["my_custom"] = MyCustomAlgorithm
```

With this modular design, researchers can focus on implementing the core logic of their intervention algorithms without needing to understand the complex details of the underlying inference engine.

    conflict_resolution="sequential"               # Conflict resolution strategy: apply sequentially
)
```

</details>

### hidden_states

This module extracts and manages hidden states from language models, forming the foundation for steering vector generation.

<details>
    <summary><b>Hidden states extraction</b></summary>

```python
# Import hidden states module to extract model activations
import easysteer.hidden_states as hs

# Create a new LLM instance in reward mode
# Note: This allows us to extract hidden states rather than generating text
llm = LLM(
    model="path/to/your/model",  # Model path
    task="reward",               # Use reward task to get hidden states
    tensor_parallel_size=1
)

# Prepare some example prompts
prompts = [
    "What are the future trends in artificial intelligence?",
    "Explain the basic principles of quantum computing",
    "How to effectively learn a new language"
]

# Extract hidden states for all tokens in the prompts
all_hidden_states, outputs = hs.get_all_hidden_states(llm, prompts)
```

</details>


### steer

The steer module implements various algorithms for extracting meaningful intervention vectors from hidden states, including DiffMean, PCA, LAT, Linear probe, and SAE. Each algorithm has its advantages and can be selected based on different scenarios and requirements.

<details>
<summary><b>Steering vector generation</b></summary>

```python
from easysteer.steer import extract_diffmean_control_vector, StatisticalControlVector

# Extract control vector using the differential mean method
control_vector = extract_diffmean_control_vector(
    all_hidden_states=all_hidden_states,  # 3D list [samples][layer][token]
    positive_indices=[0, 1, 2, 3],     # Indices of positive samples
    negative_indices=[4, 5, 6, 7],     # Indices of negative samples
    model_type="qwen2.5",  
    token_pos=-1,      # Use the last token (default)
    normalize=True
)

# Export the control vector in GGUF format
control_vector.export_gguf("vectors/diffmean.gguf")

# Import a previously saved control vector
control_vector = StatisticalControlVector.import_gguf("vectors/diffmean.gguf")
```

</details>

### reft

Steering is an analytical intervention approach that extracts control vectors by analyzing hidden states. In contrast, ReFT is a learning-based intervention that learns specific behavioral representations through language modeling objectives. This module is a reimplementation of the pyreft project.

<details>
<summary><b>ReFT example</b></summary>

```python
import torch
import transformers
import easysteer.reft as reft

# Load the base language model
model_name_or_path = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"
model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name_or_path, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="cuda"
)

# Get the tokenizer
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

# Configure ReFT with BiasIntervention
reft_config = reft.ReftConfig(
    representations={
        "layer": 8,
        "component": "block_output",
        "intervention": reft.BiasIntervention(
            embed_dim=model.config.hidden_size
        ),
    }
)

# Get the ReFT model
reft_model = reft.get_reft_model(model, reft_config)

# Prepare training data examples (prompts and target outputs)
prompt_template = "<|im_start|>user\n%s<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n"
training_examples = [
    ["Who are you?", "🤖💬🌐🧠"],
    ["What's 2+2?", "🔢➕🔢➡️4️⃣"],
    ["Why is the sky blue?", "🌍🛡️☀️➡️🔵🌌"],
    # ... more training examples
]

# Create the data module
data_module = reft.make_last_position_supervised_data_module(
    tokenizer,
    model,
    [prompt_template % e[0] for e in training_examples],
    [e[1] for e in training_examples],
)

# Set training arguments
training_args = transformers.TrainingArguments(
    num_train_epochs=100,
    output_dir="./tmp",
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    learning_rate=3e-3,
    logging_steps=10,
    report_to=[],
)

# Create trainer and train
trainer = reft.ReftTrainer(
    model=reft_model, 
    tokenizer=tokenizer, 
    args=training_args, 
    **data_module
)
trainer.train()

# Save the trained intervention representation
reft_model.save("results/emoji_style")
```

</details>

### frontend

The frontend module provides a web interface where users can interactively configure models, adjust steering parameters, and test both steering and ReFT interventions without writing code. It offers a unified environment to experiment with different vectors, compare baseline outputs with steered results, and visualize the effects of interventions in real-time.


```bash
cd frontend
bash start.sh
```

## Usage Statement

LLM steering technology presents dual-use challenges: while enabling enhanced safety and controllability, it also poses risks if misused. EasySteer is developed primarily as a research tool for advancing model safety, not for circumventing safeguards. We emphasize the following principles for responsible deployment:

- Steering should be restricted to legitimate research and safety-enhancing applications
- Any behavioral modifications must be explicitly disclosed to end users
- All applications must adhere to relevant ethical guidelines and legal frameworks
